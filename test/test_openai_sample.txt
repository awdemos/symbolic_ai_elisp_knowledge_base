Marie Curie was a Polish-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland on November 7, 1867. In 1891, she moved to Paris to study physics and mathematics at the University of Paris (Sorbonne). 

At the Sorbonne, she met Pierre Curie, a French physicist who was working on crystallography. They married in 1895 and began collaborating on research. Together, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium in 1898 (named after Marie's homeland) and radium later that same year.

Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize when she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. After Pierre's tragic death in a street accident in 1906, Marie continued their research alone. In 1911, she won a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium, making her the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences.

During World War I, Marie Curie developed mobile X-ray units, called "petites Curies," which she drove to the front lines to help treat wounded soldiers. She died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, likely caused by her prolonged exposure to radiation during her research.
