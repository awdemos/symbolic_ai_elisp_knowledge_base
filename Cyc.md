Cyc works as a large-scale knowledge representation and reasoning system implemented in software. Here are the key components and mechanisms that enable Cyc to function:

## Knowledge Base

The core of Cyc is its massive knowledge base, containing:

- Over 1.5 million concepts and 25 million rules encoded in CycL, Cyc's formal representation language[1][8].
- Knowledge organized into a global ontology, with concepts arranged in a hierarchy up to a root "Thing" category[4].
- "Microtheories" that allow Cyc to maintain potentially contradictory knowledge in different contexts[4].

## Representation Language (CycL)

CycL is based on predicate calculus and allows Cyc to express complex logical statements:

- Uses frames (units) with slots for properties and values to represent concepts[4].
- Supports higher-order logic, allowing predicates to take other predicates as arguments[9].
- Includes mechanisms for quoting, contexts, and meta-knowledge[9].

## Inference Engine

Cyc reasons over its knowledge base using:

- A general-purpose theorem prover[7].
- Over 1,000 specialized inference modules optimized for specific types of reasoning[7][8].
- Argumentation systems to compare and evaluate competing logical arguments[7].

## Interfaces

Cyc provides several ways to interact with the system:

- APIs for programmatic access to the knowledge base and inference capabilities[4].
- Browser interfaces for manually browsing and editing the knowledge base[4].
- Natural language processing components for limited language understanding and generation[6].

## Knowledge Acquisition

Cyc builds and refines its knowledge through:

- Manual entry by human "ontological engineers"[6].
- Automated learning from sources like Wikipedia[6].
- Integration with external data sources and systems[4][8].

In operation, Cyc takes queries or problems as input, uses its inference engine to reason over relevant parts of its knowledge base, and produces logical conclusions or explanations as output. The system's broad common-sense knowledge allows it to make connections and inferences across diverse domains.
