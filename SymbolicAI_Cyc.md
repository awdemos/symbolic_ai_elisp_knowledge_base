Cyc is an ambitious artificial intelligence project that aims to create a comprehensive knowledge base of human common sense reasoning. Here's how Cyc works:

## Knowledge Representation

Cyc uses a large ontology and knowledge base to represent common sense knowledge:

- The knowledge base contains millions of assertions (facts and rules) describing concepts and their relationships[1][5].
- It uses a representation language called CycL, which is similar to predicate logic[5].
- Knowledge is organized into "microtheories" - consistent sets of assertions about particular domains[6].

## Ontology Structure 

The Cyc ontology is structured hierarchically:

- It contains hundreds of thousands of terms organized into categories[1][6].
- Terms include individuals (e.g. #$BillClinton), collections (e.g. #$Tree-ThePlant), and functions[6].
- Categories are arranged in a hierarchy up to a root "Thing" category[6].

## Reasoning Engine

Cyc uses its knowledge base and ontology to perform reasoning:

- It has a general-purpose inference engine as well as specialized reasoning modules[1].
- The system can make deductions, answer queries, and fill in gaps in information using its common sense knowledge[4].
- It uses techniques like argumentation to resolve contradictions between microtheories[1].

## Knowledge Acquisition

Cyc's knowledge has been built up over decades through:

- Manual entry of assertions by human "ontological engineers"[1][4].
- Some automated learning from sources like Wikipedia and Wikidata[2].
- Ongoing expansion of the knowledge base through various projects[2].

The goal is for Cyc to accumulate enough common sense knowledge to enable human-like reasoning across a wide range of domains. While ambitious, the project continues to develop and find applications in areas like medical research and intelligence analysis[4].
