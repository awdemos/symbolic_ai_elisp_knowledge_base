Here's a list of follow-up TODOs to improve the `kb-system.el` script in markdown format:

## TODOs for kb-system.el Improvement

1. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Add proper error checking and handling for invalid inputs
   - Implement custom error types for specific scenarios

2. **Enhance Query Performance**
   - Implement indexing for faster query lookups
   - Optimize the `kb-system-query` function for large datasets

3. **Extend Ontology Capabilities**
   - Add support for multiple inheritance in the ontology
   - Implement reasoning capabilities based on the ontology structure
   - Implmenet an embedding scheme for objects to be represented as embeddings such as with sentencetransformers library.

4. **Improve Inference Engine**
   - Implement forward and backward chaining algorithms
   - Add support for probabilistic reasoning
   - Enhance the self-reward mechanism

5. **Enhance Query Language**

   - Implement a SPARQL-like query interface
   - Support OpenAI compatible API

6. **Add Persistence Layer**
   - Implement database integration for storing the knowledge base
   - Add support for incremental updates and versioning
   - This should be a vector database. 

7. **Implement Visualization**
   - Create functions to visualize the knowledge graph
   - Add support for exporting the ontology in standard formats (e.g., OWL)

8. **Improve Documentation**
   - Add detailed docstrings for all functions and macros
   - Create a user manual with examples and best practices

9. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all core functions
   - Set up continuous integration for automated testing

10. **Optimize Memory Usage**
    - Implement lazy loading for large knowledge bases
    - Add support for streaming large datasets

11. **Add Natural Language Processing**
    - Implement basic NLP capabilities for fact extraction
    - Add support for querying the knowledge base using natural language

12. **Enhance Rule System**
    - Implement a more expressive rule language
    - Add support for rule priorities and conflict resolution

13. **Implement Uncertainty Handling**
    - Extend the system to handle uncertain or conflicting information
    - Implement fuzzy logic or Bayesian networks for reasoning under uncertainty

14. **Add Temporal Reasoning**
    - Implement support for temporal facts and queries
    - Add capabilities for reasoning about time-based relationships

15. **Optimize for Concurrency**
    - Implement thread-safe operations for multi-threaded environments
    - Add support for parallel inference and query processing
    - Write a version in Rust
