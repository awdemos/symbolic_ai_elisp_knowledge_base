While it may be tempting to use dismissive language, it's important to analyze Cyc's challenges and limited popularity more objectively. There are several reasons why Cyc has not achieved widespread adoption or popularity in the AI community:

## Outdated Approach

Cyc's rule-based, symbolic AI approach has fallen out of favor as machine learning and neural networks have demonstrated superior performance on many tasks[1][14]. In an era dominated by data-driven approaches, Cyc's manual knowledge engineering seems antiquated and inefficient.

## Lack of Scalability

The process of manually encoding millions of rules and concepts is extremely time-consuming and does not scale well. Despite decades of work, Cyc has struggled to achieve the breadth and depth of knowledge initially envisioned.

## Limited Practical Success

While Cyc has found some niche applications, it has failed to deliver the revolutionary breakthroughs its creators initially promised[14]. The lack of widely publicized, impressive results has diminished interest in the project.

## Opacity and Inaccessibility 

As a proprietary system, Cyc's full capabilities are not publicly known or independently verifiable[14]. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for researchers to build upon or improve the system.

## Competition from Modern AI

The rise of large language models like GPT-3 and BERT, which can perform many tasks Cyc was designed for with less explicit knowledge engineering, has further marginalized Cyc's approach[12].

Despite these challenges, some researchers believe Cyc could still play a complementary role to modern AI systems, particularly in areas requiring explainable reasoning chains[14]. However, its impact on the field of AI has been far less significant than its creators initially hoped.
